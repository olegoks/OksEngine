# Project Context
This is an ECS (Entity Component System) based game engine project.

## Key Files
- Tools/ECSManager/ecs_manager.py: GUI utility for managing ECS system dependencies
- Sources/Engine/Sources/: Contains all ECS system files (.ecs)

## File Formats
.ecs files are Lua scripts with the following structure:
```lua
system = {
    name = "SystemName",
    runBefore = {"System1", "System2"}, -- optional
    runAfter = {"System3", "System4"},  -- optional
    -- other system-specific fields
}
```

## Core Requirements
1. All file operations must be performed using LuaContext, no string manipulations allowed
2. The utility should only modify runBefore and runAfter fields, preserving all other fields and their order
3. If a system has no dependencies, runAfter and runBefore fields should not be present in the .ecs file
4. The output .ecs file must be a valid Lua script
5. Use only .ecs files that contains variable "system"

## Dependencies
- Python 3.11+
- Required packages:
  - tkinter
  - networkx
  - matplotlib
  - lupa (for Lua integration)
  - scipy
